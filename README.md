# Braille Gestures

Braille Gesures is a standart for gesture recognition for braille symbols.
The goal is to describe every braille symbol (there are 64 symbols in total) and create a map of gestures (each symbol can have mupliple gestures).
Ultimate goal is to allow users to type text in the air - without touching any surface.

Using Braille as a mediator script would allow to reuse Gestures, since they will be the same for every Braille symbol.
Encoding Braille symbols into gestures should also reduce the amount of false-positive recignitions of symbols - since Braille is a limited subset of characters.
